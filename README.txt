To start:
The Container radius is set in the Simulation_class script in the initialisation of the Simulation class, it must also be inserted in the Other_functions script in the multi_ball function.

Ball starting velocity, mass and speed is set in the Other_functions script in the rand_ball function.

The number of frames, whether the simulation is animated and number of balls is set in the Results script.

Ensure to run cells separately in Results script to avoid graphs overlapping.
